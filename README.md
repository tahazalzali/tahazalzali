Hello, a quick recap about me.
I have a proven track record of developing cross-platform mobile applications using React Native during my tenure at Soulmed. I was responsible for creating the "Soulmed" application for both Android and iOS platforms, integrating it with the API developed using Spring Boot. Working remotely with Agile methodologies, I effectively utilized tools such as Jira Work Management and Confluence to manage projects efficiently, and I followed CI/CD principles using Bitbucket.

In my previous role as a Full Stack Developer at Webneoo, I gained valuable experience in developing applications using the Laravel framework and employing MVC design patterns. I worked with JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue, as well as PHP blades for the frontend. I demonstrated proficiency in version control using Git and GitHub, and I successfully implemented development models within Agile methodologies.

During my time as a Junior Web Developer at Hadkun Hankun, I honed my skills in website design and functionality. I utilized React JS to create physical and prototype designs, optimized websites for search engines, and enhanced website traffic. These experiences have equipped me with a solid foundation in web development, and I am confident in my ability to contribute to your organization's success.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the Lebanese International University, which has provided me with a strong technical background. Additionally, I have pursued various certifications in web development and software engineering, including the IBM DevOps and Software Engineering Specialization, Web Applications for Everybody specialization from the University of Michigan, and Front-End Web Development with React (Redux) from The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology. These credentials attest to my commitment to continuous learning and staying up-to-date with industry trends.

In addition to my technical skills, I am fluent in both Arabic and English, allowing me to effectively communicate with diverse teams and stakeholders. I am a dedicated and motivated professional, and I thrive in collaborative environments where I can contribute my skills and learn from others.
