Hi there! I'm Taha Zalzali, a passionate mobile app developer specializing in React Native. Over the last four years, I've focused on building cross-platform mobile applications for both Android and iOS. My journey in tech started with web development, leading me to embrace React.js and eventually React Native, merging my love for user-centric designs with efficient, responsive code. I'm always exploring new technologies and methodologies to enhance user experiences and streamline development processes. Welcome to my GitHub, where I share my projects and continue my journey in tech innovation!
